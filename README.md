# Recursion

Practicing two common DSA problems – Fibonacci sequence generation and array sorting using merge sort – through recursion.

## 1. Fibonacci Sequence Generator

### Function: `fibs`

- Takes a number as input
- Returns an array containing that many numbers from the Fibonacci sequence
- Example Input: `8`
- Example Output: `[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]`

### Function: `fibsRec`

- Solves the same problem as `fibs` recursively
- Utilizes recursive methodology to generate the Fibonacci sequence

## 2. Merge Sort Algorithm

### Function: `mergeSort`

- Takes an array as input
- Returns a sorted array using a recursive merge sort methodology
- Implements a divide-and-conquer strategy for efficient sorting
- Example Input: `[3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5]`
- Example Output: `[1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 9]`

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project directory in your preferred code editor.

Run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
node fibonacci.js
node merge-sort.js
````
